  Abstract                 = {Clinical decision-making involves an active interplay between various medical knowledge modalities - the spectrum of medical knowledge modalities spanning from tacit knowledge to experiential knowledge to explicit knowledge to data-induced knowledge. The ability to simultaneously access and then integrate multiple knowledge modalities pertaining to a common clinical theme is profound for clinical decision making. In this concept paper we introduce knowledge morphing - a knowledge modeling task that allows the integration of heterogeneous medical knowledge modalities, with respect to a clinical case, to yield a comprehensive knowledge resource for decision-support.},

We will show how broad classes of algorithms can be extended to the uncertain data setting. In particular, we will study candidate generate-and-test algorithms, hyper-structure algorithms and pattern growth based algorithms. One of our insightful observations is that the experimental behavior of different classes of algorithms is very different in the uncertain case as compared to the deterministic case. In particular, the hyper-structure and the candidate generate-and-test algorithms perform much better than tree-based algorithms. This counter-intuitive behavior is an important observation from the perspective of algorithm design of the uncertain variation of the problem. We will test the approach on a number of real and synthetic data sets, and show the effectiveness of two of our approaches over competitive techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: The purpose of our current study was to determine whether our disease-management model was associated with long-term survival benefits. A secondary objective was to determine whether program involvement was associated with medication maintenance and reduced hospitalization over time compared to usual care management of heart failure. Design: A retrospective chart review was conducted in patients who had been hospitalized for congestive heart failure between April 1999 and March 31, 2000, and had been discharged from the hospital for follow-up in the Heart Failure Clinic vs usual care. Setting: An integrated health-care center serving a tristate area. Patients: Patients (n = 101) were followed up for 4 years after their index hospitalization for congestive heart failure. Measurements and results: The patients followed up in the Heart Failure Clinic comprised group 1 (n = 38), and the patients receiving usual care made up group 2 (n = 63). The mean (± SD) age of the patients in group 1 was 68 ± 16 years compared to 76 ± 11 years for the patients in group 2 (p = 0.002). The patients in group 1 were more likely to have renal failure (p = 0.035), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.005), and hypotension at baseline (p = 0.002). At year 2, more patients in group 1 were maintained by therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) [p = 0.036]. The survival rate over 4 years was better for group 1. Univariate Cox proportional hazard ratios revealed that age, not receiving ACEIs or ARBs, and renal disease or cancer at baseline were associated with mortality. When controlling for these variables in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio model, survival differences between groups remained significant (p = 0.021). Subjects in group 2 were 2.4 times more likely to die over the 4-year period than those in group 1. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that, after controlling for baseline variables, patients participating in a heart failure clinic enjoyed improved survival.},

It aims at developing and testing of a microcontroller based signal monitoring device for cardiovascular studies. The advantages of this system show up in decreasing the associated cost, as well as in increasing its functionality, making the necessary human intervention minimal. The algorithmic component of the project will focus on the main hemodynamic issues currently addressed in literature: separating incident from reflected pulse waves (augmentation index), waveform variability and transfer function. Although, additional studies are still required to attain clinical validation, this system seems to be a valid, low cost and easy to use alternative to the highly costly devices in the market.},

Considering that the photo-plethysmographic (PPG) waveform is a pressure-induced signal, the correlation between the pulse features with pressure-resistance characteristics of the vessels was derived. By means of the pulse-contour-analysis (PCA) specific amplitudes, systolic slope, dicrotic transit time etc. can be extracted.

Scarce resources cannot be sustained unless innovative technology is considered to provide health care in a more effective way.

Much research and development has been focused on the technological side (e.g., sensors and networks) but less effort has been invested in the capability of the Smart Home to intelligently monitor situations of interest and act in the best interest of the occupants. In this article we model a Smart Home scenario, using knowledge in the form of Event-Condition-Action rules together with a new inference scheme which incorporates spatio-temporal reasoning and uncertainty. A reasoning system called RIMER, has been extended to permit the monitoring of situations according to the place where they occur and the specific order and duration of the activities. The system allows for the specification of uncertainty both in terms of knowledge representation and credibility of the conclusions that can be achieved in terms of the evidence available.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing medical devices and equipment monitor abnormal physiological conditions and trigger audio-visual alarms. However, these devices require high levels of interaction by a doctor since they do not have any self-managing capabilities to reduce user intervention or to autonomically handle alerts. Recent advances in low-power wireless communication technologies have led to the development of small form-factor, wireless, body-wearable biomedical devices for health monitoring [1]. This enables patient mobility and comfort and enables continuity of care from hospital to home. In this paper we propose a self-managing framework for health monitoring using body-wearable bio-devices [2] that can reduce the doctor's intervention for patient management. This will enable doctors to effectively manage a greater number of patients and reduce the number of errors inherent in paper-based processes.

  Abstract                 = {Various ECG instruments have addressed a wide variety of clinical and technical issues. However, there is still scope for improvement in them particularly in the area of their susceptibility to noise, lack of universal connectivity and off-line processing. In emergency situations, real-time health parameter is crucial. According to the American Heart Association [1], treatment of a patient experiencing ventricular fibrillation within the first 12 minutes of cardiac arrest brings a survival rate of 48%-75%. The survival rate drops to 2%-4% after 12 minutes have gone. This paper illustrates a low-cost method for realtime acquisition of ECG signal for storage and processing using a Matlab®-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). This costly effective design can be interesting for the third world medical device industry to develop such device locally instead of buying the technology with high cost from the western countries. The ECG device is wirelessly connected to a smart phone or a computer using IEEE 802.15.1 based radio protocol. It includes an analog system and a Bluetooth transceiver, flexible and stretchable for comfortable continuous cardiac monitoring. The Matlab®-based GUI is designed to perform real-time analysis on the ECG data to compute the different waves features and display the same on the GUI along with the ECG signal plot.},

  Abstract                 = {Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a popular industry standard that provides an elegant model to create and compose interoperable applications. In the case of sensor networks, SOA is considered to be a very attractive enabler for sensor programmability and self-integration. However, SOA cannot be used without additional mechanisms to enhance the reliability and availability of the sensors behind the services. In the absence of such mechanisms, sensor-based SOA could provide a false promise of service whose, quality and availability are highly questionable and cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Sensor framework for service-oriented sensor networks with the aim of enhancing reliability, prolonging availability and enabling automatic service composability. We classify and model three useful virtual sensor concepts and present compensation algorithms for coping with sensor failure. To quantify the merit of our approach, we developed a Data Quality Indicator measure for expressing the perceived quality of virtual sensor readings.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, wireless medical body area network (WMBAN) plays an important role in remote cardiac patient monitoring, intelligent emergency care management system, and ubiquitous mobile healthcare applications. The wearable cardiac monitoring devices used in WMBAN system collect and transmit the vital signs of cardiac patients continuously. Generally, the use of WMBAN technology is restricted by size, power consumption, transmission capacity (bandwidth), and computational loads. Therefore, there is a great demand for low-complexity cardiac signal processing algorithms that can combat some of technical challenges related to pervasive healthcare computing with WMBAN technologies. In this paper, we present low complexity automatic QRS detection algorithm for long-term wearable cardiac monitoring device. The proposed QRS detection method first derives a smooth Shannon energy envelogram (SEE) of the first-derivative of the filtered ECG at the preprocessing stage. The major local maxima (LM) in the smooth SEE indicate the approximate locations of the R-peaks. In the second stage, the proposed HT-based peak-finding logic identifies the locations of the LM by detecting the positive zero-crossings in the HT of the SEE. Finally, the locations of the LM are used as guides to find the accurate locations of the R-peaks in the ECG signal. The proposed method is validated using the standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and achieves an overall sensitivity of 99.86% and positive predictivity of 99.95%. Various experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other well-known algorithms in case of noisy or pathological signals.},

The method uses a recently developed time-frequency spectral estimation method, variable-frequency complex demodulation (VFCDM), to identify frequency modulation (FM) of the photoplethysmogram waveform. This FM has a measurable periodicity, which provides an estimate of the respiration period. We compared the performance of VFCDM to the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and autoregressive (AR) model approaches. The CWT method also utilizes the respiratory sinus arrhythmia effect as represented by either FM or AM to estimate respiratory rates. Both CWT and AR model methods have been previously shown to provide reasonably good estimates of breathing rates that are in the normal range (12-26 breaths/min). However, to our knowledge, breathing rates higher than 26 breaths/min and the real-time performance of these algorithms are yet to be tested. Our analysis based on 15 healthy subjects reveals that the VFCDM method provides the best results in terms of accuracy (smaller median error), consistency (smaller interquartile range of the median value), and computational efficiency (less than 0.3 s on 1 min of data using a MATLAB implementation) to extract breathing rates that varied from 12-36 breaths/min.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective To describe the 6-year probability of survival for older adults after their first hospitalization for heart failure. Setting National Medicare hospital claims records for 1984 through 1986 and Medicare enrollment records from 1986 through 1992. Design We identified a national cohort of 170,239 (9% black patients) Medicare patients, 67 years or older, with no evidence of heart failure in 1984 or 1985, who were hospitalized and discharged for the first time in 1986 with a principal diagnosis of heart failure. For groups defined by race, sex, age, Medicaid eligibility, and comorbid conditions, we compared the probability of survival with Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Only 19% of black men, 16% of white men, 25% of black women, and 23% of white women survived 6 years. One third died within the first year. Men had lower median survival and 38% greater risk of mortality than did women (P<.05). White men had 10% greater risk of mortality than did black men (P<.05). Medicaid eligibility (white adults only) and diabetes were associated with increased mortality (P<.05). Conclusions The prognosis for older adults with heart failure underscores the importance of prevention strategies and early detection and treatment modalities that can prevent, improve, or reverse myocardial dysfunction, particularly for the growing number of adults who are at increased risk for developing heart failure because of hypertension, diabetes, or myocardial infarction.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper concerns a problem which is basic to perception: the integration of perceptual information into a coherent description of the world. In this paper we present perception as a process of dynamically maintaining a model of the local external environment. Fusion of perceptual information is at the heart of this process. After a brief introduction, we review the background of the problem of fusion in machine vision. We then present fusion as part of the process of dynamic world modelling, and postulate a set of principles for the ‘fusion’ of independent observations. These principles lead to techniques which permit perceptual fusion with qualitatively different forms of data, treating each source of information as constraints. For numerical information, these principles lead to specific well known tools such as various forms of Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. For symbolic information, these principles suggest representing objects and their relations as a conjunction of properties encoded as schema. Dynamic world modelling is a cyclic process composed of the phases: predict, match and update. These phases provide a framework with which we can organize and design perceptual systems. We show that in the case of numerical measurements, this framework leads to the use of a form of Kalman filter for the prediction and update phases, while a Mahalanobis distance is used for matching. In the case of symbolic information, elements of the framework can be constructed with schema and production rules. The framework for perceptual information is illustrated with the architectures of several systems.},

The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure. The authors used logistic regression to study the effects of telehomecare on health services utilization and mortality and a general linear model to analyze changes in self-reported symptoms. On average, patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group. Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days. Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients. The technology enables frequent monitoring of clinical indices and permits the home health care nurse to detect changes in cardiac status and intervene when necessary.},

  Abstract                 = {Tiered sensor network architectures are gaining currency. In contrast with flat networks of impoverished nodes (the hitherto common assumption in sensor networking), such systems offer the promise of migrating computational load from sensing nodes to higher capability ’master’ nodes. We argue that for certain data fusion-based services this means that compute intensive algorithms, often shunned as impractical for sensor networks, are in fact a viable possibility. Using localization as an example, we show how accurate results may be obtained by leveraging this capability without the use of specialized hardware or high configuration detail; both of which are standard approaches to the problem when computation is at a premium. Specifically, we propose a mathematical optimization-based framework for localization based on proximity constraints. Most variants of localization can be cast into this framework depending on the kinds of input available (e.g. ranging). We show accurate results, and exploit a technique from distributed optimization to divide the problem into pieces suitable for computation at the master-level nodes. We conclude with remarks on the general implications of this example for tiered systems, with pointers on how it is likely to be applicable to other problems such as power-aware routing.},

In general, there was good agreement between the SBP/DBP-measurements based on auscultatory Korotkoff-I- and IV-criteria and the reference method; the average method difference in estimating the isoprenaline responses for SBPa-SBPg was: -1.1, 95% CI: -5.4 to 3.1 mm Hg with a within-subject between-method repeatability coefficient (REP) of 11.6 mm Hg and for DBPa-IV-DBPg: 3.5, 95% CI: -0.5 to 6.5 mm Hg, REP: 11.5 mm Hg.

Oscillometry yielded good approximations for the SBP response to isoprenaline (average method difference SBPo-SBPg: -2.9, 95% CI: -9.0 to 3.3 mm Hg, REP: 17.6 mm Hg) but was poorly sensitive with regard to the DBP responses: method difference DBPo-DBPg: 6.5, 95% CI: -1.3 to 14.3 mm Hg, REP: 25.7 mm Hg. 4.

Although several published methods could give reasonable results for this purpose, for some applications, they still have drawbacks in some respects, e.g., requiring multi-channel ECG signal, being robust-less against noise, etc.. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we investigate the possibility of obtaining respiratory knowledge from a single-channel ECG signal based on its higher order statistics, which is a notable feature that the conventional methods do not hold. Another worthy of mention feature is that the method depends on Rwave detections only, such that other feature detections, e.g., Q-wave or S-wave detection, are not necessary anymore for the processing. This feature does not make the processing simpler only, with the feature related to higher order statistics together, but it also strengthens the robustness against noise. Our experiments show the improved performances with the method.},

Rapid progress in sensing hardware, communications and low-power computing has resulted in a profusion of commercially available sensor nodes. The big challenge now is to develop effective methods for the automatic fusion and interpretation of the information generated by large-scale sensor networks. The success of future applications is predicated on finding solutions to this data fusion challenge.This talk will focus on probabilistic models and Bayesian data fusion methods appropriate to describing and solving sensor network data fusion problems. Over a number of years, we have used such methods to develop decentralised algorithms for point-target estimation in sensor networks. More recently, other researchers have developed distributed Bayesian algorithms for sensor networks to estimate field properties, such as temperature or humidity over an area. The prospect of developing holistic Bayesian methods for fusion in sensor networks now looks to be a real and exciting possibility. This talk will describe these potential developments. Notions of divergence and information appear naturally in probabilistic fusion algorithms. In turn these provide a handle on two other sensor network data fusion problems; how to model and manage sensor node performance and how to learn patterns in or interpret sensor network information. These ideas will also be developed in this talk. Interspersed amongst these developments we will describe some real sensor network applications, some solved, some currently being addressed, and some that remain as a challenge to network data fusion methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe a newly developed displacement current sensor for non-contact, non-invasive human electrophysiological measurements, well suited for applications requiring remote detection of human presence. The sensor is built around an improvised transimpedance amplifier circuit, which employs a resistive feedback T-network to eliminate the need for ultra high values resistors normally needed for this type of measurements. It provides an operational bandwidth of 0.5-250 Hz and a remarkable noise floor of 7.8 #x03BC;V/ #x221A;Hz at 1Hz down to 30 nV/ #x221A;Hz at 1 kHz. The sensor is particularly suitable for non-contact measurement of human electrophysiological signals, such as the ECG. Reported results, all obtained in normal unshielded environment, demonstrate the sensor's capability in measuring human heart related electrophysiological signals at off-body distance up to 50 cm. Two different sensor configurations are presented; a single-ended signal measurement using one sensor, and a differential signal measurement using two sensors.},

  Abstract                 = {Measuring an event of interest is not always as simple as placing a sensor with the desired properties in an appropriate measurement location to observe the event. Often, sensors cannot be placed at the desired site for numerous reasons (e.g. weight, space, and power issues). The desired measurement can often be derived through the use of other embedded native sensors, networked sensors and test specific sensors possessing appropriate metadata supporting extended use / reuse of measurement data. These measures are then used within a performance model to fuse data and derive a composite measure for the overall performance taking into account all of the discrete parameters and their performance variations both good and bad in determining overall system performance. This paper utilizes concepts for metadata and sensors allowing seamless selection and construction of non-physical (non-contact) synthetic sensors using embedded sensors and native metadata specifications.},

To expand the capabilities of the mote for healthcare applications we now introduce EKG on Mica2, the first custom-designed electrocardiograph sensor board to interface with this platform.

  Abstract                 = {Pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV), respectively, were shown to have a correlation with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and have been reported to be suitable for indirect BP measurements. The aim of this study was to create a function between SBP and PWV, and to test its reliability for the determination of absolute SBP using a non-linear algorithm and a one-point calibration. 63 volunteers performed exercise to induce rises in BP. Arterial PTT was measured between the R-spike of the ECG and the plethysmographic curve of finger pulse-oximetry. The reference BP was measured using a cuff-based sphygmomanometric aneroid device. Data from 13 of the 63 volunteers served for the detection of the PWV-BP relationship. The created non-linear function was used to calculate BP values after individual correction for the BP offset in a group of 50 volunteers. Individual correlation coefficients for SBP measured by PTT (SBP(PTT)) and by cuff (SBP(CUFF)) varied between r = 0.69 and r = 0.99. Taking all data together, we found r = 0.83 (276 measurements in 50 volunteers). In the Bland-Altman plot, the limits of agreement were [Formula: see text]± 19.8 mmHg. In conclusion, comparing SBP values using the PTT-based method and those measured by cuff resulted in a significant correlation. However, the Bland-Altman plot shows relevant differences between both methods, which are partly due to greater variability of the SBP(PTT) measurement during intensified exercise. Results suggest that PTT can be used for measuring absolute SBP when performing an individual correction for the offset of the BP-PWV relation.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite major advances in treatment options for heart failure patients, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Frequent readmissions are distressful for patients and are associated with large costs for society. In an attempt to improve care for heart failure patients and thereby reduce morbidity and hospital readmissions, specialised heart failure clinics have emerged over the last 10 years. In particular, clinics relying, at least in part, on nurses specially trained in heart failure have gained popularity. This review of the published literature describes the wide variety of designs and the types of interventions taking place in such heart failure clinics.A total of 18 randomised studies comparing heart failure clinics using nurse intervention with conventional care have been published to date, and the majority of these have shown either a reduction in hospital readmissions or shortening of hospitalisations in the intervention group. These findings are supported by the results of several non-randomised, controlled investigations. Thus, it is concluded that heart failure clinics using nurse intervention should be an integrated part of the care process for patients with heart failure wherever possible. We argue that ongoing attention should be paid to the quality of care delivered by the clinics to ensure that the benefit of this intervention strategy persists. Thus, it would be of importance to continuously record relevant data describing the care process using specific indicators such as ACE-inhibitor and ?ý-blocker use and doses. One possible, practical method to apply such continuous quality assurance may be by means of electronic medical record databases.},

In this study, we propose a novel frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent pattern mining methods.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES We sought to identify whether home telemonitoring (HTM) improves outcomes compared with nurse telephone support (NTS) and usual care (UC) for patients with heart failure who are at high risk of hospitalization or death. BACKGROUND Heart failure is associated with a high rate of hospitalization and poor prognosis. Telemonitoring could help implement and maintain effective therapy and detect worsening heart failure and its cause promptly to prevent medical crises. METHODS Patients with a recent admission for heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% were assigned randomly to HTM, NTS, or UC in a 2:2:1 ratio. HTM consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center. The NTS consisted of specialist nurses who were available to patients by telephone. Primary care physicians delivered UC. The primary end point was days dead or hospitalized with NTS versus HTM at 240 days. RESULTS Of 426 patients randomly assigned, 48% were aged >70 years, mean LVEF was 25% (SD, 8) and median plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 3,070 pg/ml (interquartile range 1,285 to 6,749 pg/ml). During 240 days of follow-up, 19.5%, 15.9%, and 12.7% of days were lost as the result of death or hospitalization for UC, NTS, and HTM, respectively (no significant difference). The number of admissions and mortality were similar among patients randomly assigned to NTS or HTM, but the mean duration of admissions was reduced by 6 days (95% con?dence interval 1 to 11) with HTM. Patients randomly assigned to receive UC had higher one-year mortality (45%) than patients assigned to receive NTS (27%) or HTM (29%) (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS Further investigation and refinement of the application of HTM are warranted because it may be a valuable role for the management of selected patients with heart failure.

A 12-item scale (the Duke Activity Status index) was then developed that correlated well with peak oxygen uptake (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.80). To test this new index, an independent group of 50 subjects completed a self-administered questionnaire to determine functional capacity and underwent exercise testing with measurement of peak oxygen uptake. The Duke Activity Status Index correlated significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) with peak oxygen uptake (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.58) in this independent sample.

In the development stage, an auxiliary instrumentation for signal acquisition and digital signal processing using LabVIEW, which is also known as virtual instrument (VI), is incorporated for learning and experimentation purpose. Since the most problematic part of metrological evaluation of an oscillometric NIBP system is in the proprietary algorithms of determining systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the amplitude algorithm is used. The VI is a useful tool for studying data acquisition and signal processing to determine SBP and DBP from the maximum of the oscillations envelope. The knowledge from VI procedures is then adopted into a stand alone NIBP device. SBP and DBP are successfully obtained using the circuit developed for the NIBP device. The work done is a proof of design concept that requires further refinement.},

This study gives an overview of nursing care for patients with heart failure as described in practice, literature and standard nursing care plans. Based on interviews of 45 nurses, a review of all pertinent literature published between 1983 and 1993 and a review of standard nursing care plans used in the Netherlands to care for patients with heart failure, four composite themes emerged; namely, basic nursing care, assessment and observation, symptom-relieving interventions, and patient education. Caring for patients with heart failure is very complex and is often aimed at keeping a very delicate balance between, e.g. rest and activity, fluid intake and elimination, and therapeutic cost and benefit. Treatment strategies for optimizing care for these patients are described.},

Change in intensity of light transmitted through tissue due to arterial blood pulse can be measured as a voltage signal. This technique is called Photoplethysmography (PPG), and can be used to calculate the heart rate. Furthermore, oxygenated blood has different light absorption characteristics than deoxygenated blood under Red and Infrared wavelengths. Comparing the two absorptions can produce an estimate of the oxygen saturation of the blood. Time Multiplexing was sued to collect the two PPGs (Red and Infrared) simultaneously.

Difficulties physically sensing and determining symptom meaning may lead to uncertainty and delay treatment. Somatic awareness may provide insight into symptom monitoring ability. A model combining physical and cognitive aspects of the symptom experience was developed to examine factors affecting care-seeking among HF patients. Adults hospitalized with acute HF were interviewed and completed questionnaires measuring somatic awareness and uncertainty. HF symptom duration prior to admission measured delay. HF specific somatic awareness and symptom pattern predicted delay. Uncertainty correlated with somatic awareness, but did not predict delay. Few responded to early HF symptoms delaying until acutely ill. Development of interventions to improve symptom monitoring is needed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 29:74–86, 2006},

Patients have difficulty differentiating HF symptoms from comorbid illness or aging. The study purpose was to identify the number, type, and combination of symptoms in hospitalized HF patients and test relationships with comorbid illness and age. A secondary analysis from a HF registry (N = 687) was conducted. The sample was 51.7% female, mean age 71 +/- 12.5 years. The theory of unpleasant symptoms informed the study regarding the multidimensional nature of symptoms. Factor analysis of nine items from the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire resulted in three factors, acute and chronic volume overload and emotional distress. Clusters occurred more frequently in older patients, but caused less impact.},

Nurses reported having data on 7% to 94% of the data elements. Whether a lipid profile had been done, the HbA1C (glycosolated hemoglobin test, also called a hemoglobin A1C) levels, or ejection fractions were known for 7%, 17%, and 18%, respectively. When nurses reported information related to ACE-I use (N = 183), they reported that 76% of patients were on ACE-I (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or acceptable alternative for heart failure. But no information was reported on ACE-I use for 12% of the patients (N = 24). Potential solutions to these deficits in information and quality include increased use of guidelines in home care, guideline checklists, information transfer forms, nurse activism to request information, and the adoption of the electronic health record.},

  Abstract                 = {Telemedicine is the use of technology to provide healthcare over a distance. Telehomecare, a form of telemedicine based in the patient's home, is a communication and clinical information system that enables the interaction of voice, video, and health-related data using ordinary telephone lines. Most home care agencies are adopting telehomecare to assist with the care of the growing population of chronically ill adults. This article presents a summary and critique of the published empirical evidence about the effects of telehomecare on older adult patients with chronic illness. The knowledge gained will be applied in a discussion regarding telehomecare optimization and areas for future research. The referenced literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, CDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, and CINAHL databases was searched for the years 1995-2005 using the keywords "telehomecare" and "telemedicine," and limited to primary research and studies in English. Approximately 40 articles were reviewed. Articles were selected if telehealth technology with peripheral medical devices was used to deliver home care for adult patients with chronic illness. Studies where the intervention consisted of only telephone calls or did not involve video or in-person nurse contact in the home were excluded. Nineteen studies described the effects of telehomecare on adult patients, chronic illness outcomes, providers, and costs of care. Patients and providers were accepting of the technology and it appears to have positive effects on chronic illness outcomes such as self-management, rehospitalizations, and length of stay. Overall, due to savings from healthcare utilization and travel, telehomecare appears to reduce healthcare costs. Generally, studies have small sample sizes with diverse types and doses of telehomecare intervention for a select few chronic illnesses; most commonly heart failure. Very few published studies have explored the cost or quality implications since the change in home care reimbursement to prospective payment. Further research is needed to clarify how telehomecare can be used to maximize its benefits among diverse adult chronic illness populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The completion of Human Genome Project in 2001 yields the entirety of human genetic information, or genome. A genome is organized in chromosomes and composed of thousands of genes, which are the heredity units of traits such as hair color and blood type. Genes in complex organisms such as primates and humans are composed of regions that code for protein, called exons, and non-coding regions, called introns. During the transcription from the DNA template for later translating into amino acid chain of protein structure, introns are to be removed and exons are then joined to form a continuous messenger-RNA strand. Splice sites are the junctions or borders between introns and exons. Accurate detection of splice sites from the fragments of DNA sequence is important to the success of gene prediction. Due to huge amount of genetic information in most genomes, computational techniques are essential for the interpretation and recognition of specific genetic sequences. In this paper, we propose a splice site prediction technique based on frequent pattern analysis. We apply association mining to each splice junction types, that is, exon/intron, intron/exon, and none of the two types. The frequent DNA patterns are then combined and prioritized with respect to their annotated confidence and support values. The final result of our method is a set of cascaded rules to be used for gene prediction. From the experimental results, our method can make a high recall prediction comparative to other classification-based methods. We also demonstrate computational improvement via a concurrency technique. Running time reduction is considerably observable.},

Certain frequent patterns with low minimum support (minsup) value can provide useful information in many real-world applications. However, extraction of these frequent patterns with single minsup-based frequent pattern mining algorithms such as Apriori and FP-growth leads to "rare item problem." That is, at high minsup value, the frequent patterns with low minsup are missed, and at low minsup value, the number of frequent patterns explodes. In the literature, "multiple minsups framework" was proposed to discover frequent patterns. Furthermore, frequent pattern mining techniques such as Multiple Support Apriori and Conditional Frequent Pattern-growth (CFP-growth) algorithms have been proposed. As the frequent patterns mined with this framework do not satisfy downward closure property, the algorithms follow different types of pruning techniques to reduce the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient CFP-growth algorithm by proposing new pruning techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed pruning techniques are effective.},

Patient recognition of changes in their HF and COPD baseline status cueing imminent exacerbation onset are poor, due somewhat to disease related alterations in comatic awareness and cognition. Strategies to improve patient symptom recognition, self care behaviors and treatment seeking are necessary to improve overall health outcomes in these disease populations. The aim of this exploratory-descriptive pilot study is to test the feasibility of a wireless realtime health monitoring device in enhancing patien symptom recognition skills and guiding self-care and treatment seeking behaviors. A secondary aim is to validate the Self-care of HF instrument and Modified HF somatic Awareness Scale in the COPD population. This study is innovative in its inclusion of the patient as an active partner in the use of technology to monitor changes in physiologic indicators to alert them to baseline status changes and guide self-care decision-making. The findings from our experiments may lead to a new understanding of the role and possible benefits of including the patient more closely in their own health care and may lead to new theraputic procedures and avenues for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Self-care management in heart failure (HF) involves decision-making to evaluate, and actions to ameliorate symptoms when they occur. This study sought to compare the risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, or emergency-room admission among HF patients who practice above-average self-care management, those who practice below-average self-care management, and those who are symptom-free. Methods A secondary analysis was conducted of data collected on 195 HF patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the association between self-care management and event risk. Results The sample consisted of older (mean ± standard deviation&#xa0;=&#xa0;61.3&#xa0;±&#xa0;11 years), predominantly male (64.6%) adults, with an ejection fraction of 34.7% ± 15.3%; 60.1% fell within New York Heart Association class III or IV HF. During an average follow-up of 364&#xa0;±&#xa0;288 days, 4 deaths, 82 hospitalizations, and 5 emergency-room visits occurred as first events. Controlling for 15 common confounders, those who engaged in above-average self-care management (hazard ratio, .44; 95% confidence interval, .22 to .88; P &lt; .05) and those who were symptom-free (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .24 to .97; P &lt; .05) ran a lower risk of an event during follow-up than those engaged in below-average self-care management. Conclusion Symptomatic HF patients who practice above-average self-care management have an event-free survival benefit similar to that of symptom-free HF patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Mining for association rules and frequent patterns is a central activity in data mining. However, most existing algorithms are only moderately suitable for real-world scenarios. Most strategies use parameters like minimum support, for which it can be very difficult to define a suitable value for unknown datasets. Since most untrained users are unable or unwilling to set such technical parameters, we address the problem of replacing the minimum-support parameter with top-n strategies. In our paper, we start by extending a top-n implementation of the ECLAT algorithm to improve its performance by using heuristic search strategy optimizations. Also, real-world datasets are often distributed and modern database architectures are switching from expensive SMPs to cheaper shared-nothing blade servers. Thus, most mining queries require distribution handling. Since partitioning can be forced by user-defined semantics, it is often forbidden to transform the data. Therefore, we developed an adaptive top-n frequent-pattern mining algorithm that simplifies the mining process on real distributions by relaxing some requirements on the results. We first combine the PARTITION and the TPUT algorithms to handle distributed top-n frequent-pattern mining. Then, we extend this new algorithm for distributions with real-world data characteristics. For frequent-pattern mining algorithms, equal distributions are important conditions, and tiny partitions can cause performance bottlenecks. Hence, we implemented an approach called MAST that defines a minimum absolute-support threshold. MAST prunes patterns with low chances of reaching the global top-n result set and high computing costs. In total, our approach simplifies the process of frequent-pattern mining for real customer scenarios and data sets. This may make frequent-pattern mining accessible for very new user groups. Finally, we present results of our algorithms when run on the SAP NetWeaver BW Acceleratorwith standard and real business datasets.},

The algorithm is implemented in two phases. First, we construct a U2P-tree that compresses the information in the target database. Then, we use the U2P-tree to discover frequent U2 patterns. Potential frequent U2 patterns are derived by combining base intervals and verified by traversing the U2P-tree. We also develop two techniques to speed up the mining process. Since the proposed method is based on a tree-traversing strategy, it is both efficient and scalable. Our experimental results demonstrate that the U2P-Miner algorithm outperforms three widely used algorithms, namely, the modified Apriori, modified H-mine, and modified depth-first backtracking algorithms.},

It is possible, and potentially useful in various settings, to use systolic blood pressure waveform intervals to estimate HPV, but the validity of HPV derived from blood pressure (BP) waveforms has not been established. To test the reliability between BP- and ECG-derived HPV indexes, we evaluated data from 234 healthy adults in four studies of HPV reactivity to stress. Study conditions included resting baseline, arithmetic, Stroop test, speech presentation, and orthostatic tilt. Continuous ECG and BP recordings were sampled at a rate of 500 Hz, scored by the same methods, and used to calculate heart rate and time- and frequency-domain measures of HPV. Overall, reliability between the two methods was very high for computing heart rate and HPV indexes. High-frequency HPV indexes were somewhat less reliably computed. In conclusion, in healthy adults, with the use of appropriate methods, BP waveforms can produce reliable indexes of HPV.},

We leverage the system’s hierarchical structure to trigger cameras equipped with reconfigurable devices to carry out various types of machine vision for medical sensing and monitoring. The system is composed of various heterogeneous embedded devices, with various computation capabilities and power costs, and hence the system is arranged in a hierarchical fashion in order to take advantage of the low cost devices to wirelessly trigger the operation and the actuation of the more capable but higher cost vision systems. The experimentation provide substantive data to confirm that the coordination of the two types of sensors can have a large potential to decrease cycles of execution on the FPGA, and hence allow for power savings or the addition of tailoring of the vision applications.},

  Abstract                 = {In critically ill neonates, the risk associated with rapid changes in oxygen saturation is high where peripheral perfusion may drop below the minimum required for tissue oxygenation and cellular respiration. Using pulse oximetry is appealing because it is non-invasive and easy to use. However, optimal pulse oximetry accuracy depends on the selection of a monitoring site characterized by good perfusion with oxygen saturation. One hundred and fifty (89 male and 61 female) preterm newborns regardless ethnic group and delivery norm were recruited in this study. The study design in this research was the readings of the oxygen saturation and perfusion index during their hospitalization. A comparison study was to evaluate the perfusion and oxygen saturation of the palm and foot. Mathematical modeling was used to model the correlation between the oxygen saturation and blood perfusion. With the analysis made, perfusion index correlates positively with oxygen saturation for both palm and foot sensor (r = 0.91, r = 0.92) respectively. Nevertheless, the placement between foot and palm showed no significant difference (p lt;; 0.2). As a conclusion, pulse oximetry method is a useful tool to indicate the blood perfusion in neonates.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of blood pressure (BP) measuring devices nowadays rely on a common concept of inflatable cuff to the arm which applied auscultotary or oscillometry principle. By having a cuff, the efficiency of the device will be reduced in terms power consumption, restriction of frequency and also ease of use. Therefore this project is aimed at designing a noninvasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation system based on pulse transit time (PTT) technique. Based on previous work of others, the photo-plethysmographic (PPG) circuit is designed to be interface to personal computer utilize PIC 16B77A as data acquisition system and Bluetooth as communication interface. The algorithm to measure PTT from R of generated electrocardiogram (ECG) to base point of PPG waveform was developed using Visual Basic 6 (VB6) which this programming also used to develop the graphical user interfaces (GUI) to display the estimated SBP and DBP by offline and online process. The results have shown that the PTT measurement between ECG and PPG of pulse oximeter have a great potential for blood pressure estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bluetooth SIG recently released the Health Device Profile (HDP) in an effort to standardize health device communication using Bluetooth technology. HDP uses the IEEE 11073-20601 Data Exchange Protocol as the transport content. The same traffic can be sent using the popular Serial Port Profile (SPP), but this profile is not configured for health device communication. HDP #x02019;s strict configurations and health device-specific requirements give the impression that it would have a reduced performance in comparison to SPP. In this paper we compare HDP with SPP by analyzing multi-rate data transmission in the context of a cardiovascular monitoring application. In particular, we model the expected number of transmissions and packet loss incurred by the two profiles. Our results show that in contrast to popular belief the transmission energy is similar for both profiles, but HDP offers the advantage of plug-and-play interoperability.},

However, frequent-pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be truly efficient or effective. In many applications, it is sufficient to generate and examine frequent patterns with a sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in full precision. Such a compact but close-enoughfrequent-pattern base is called a condensed frequent-pattern base. In this paper, we propose and examine several alternatives for the design, representation, and implementation of such condensed frequent-pattern bases. Several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed. Their effectiveness at pattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated. A systematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases, and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in handling frequent-pattern mining in large databases.},

  Abstract                 = {The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis},

It can be used to detect respiratory disorders like bronchial asthma by analyzing the recorded breathing pattern. Though there are devices like spirometer to diagnose asthma, they are very inconvenient for patient's use because patients are made to exhale air through mouth forcefully. Presently developed sensor will overcome this limitation and is helpful in the diagnosis of respiratory related abnormalities. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in cantilever configuration is used as a sensing element to form the breath sensor. Two identical sensors are mounted on a spectacle frame, such that the tidal flow of inhaled and exhale air will impinge on sensor, for sensing the breathing patterns. These patterns are recorded, filtered, analyzed and displayed using CRO. Further the sensor is calibrated using a U-tube water manometer. The added advantage of piezoelectric type sensing element is that it is self powered without the need of any external power source.},

The paper aims, in particular, to explore the effect on the signal quality of distance D between the sensing apparatus and the patient. The measurement method proposed is based on the measurement of the phase variation of the reflection coefficient (S11) signal measured by a vectorial network analyzer connected to a double ridge horn antenna. The S11 signal has been compared with the synchronous acquisition made by means of a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDVi), measuring the thorax oscillations caused by the respiratory activity. Both signals have been filtered in order to eliminate the effect of high frequency disturbances (heartbeat) and noise. Results show an high correlation between respiration peaks measured with the proposed system and with LDVi; a reduction of the amplitude of the S11 signal phase (as well as the SNR) is reported in correspondence to an increasing of the distance D (-0.11 dB/cm). Tests have been repeated for standing as well as for sitting condition of the subject confirming a better signal quality for the later. Despite the fact that S11 phase variation and SNR are reduced by the distance D, in our experiments, it is still possible to correctly measure the respiration period up to 2.5 m. Data measured show that the reflectometeric approach can be used to monitor at distance with sufficient high SNR (18 dB at 2.5 m) the respiration activity of a subject without the need of a direct contact with the subject skin by means of electrods of sensing belts.},

We confirm the accuracy of measurements of breathing rate, cardiac R-R intervals, and blood oxygen saturation, by comparisons to standard methods for making such measurements (respiration belts, ECGs, and pulse-oximeters, respectively). Measurement of respiratory rate uses a previously reported algorithm developed for use with a pulse-oximeter, based on amplitude and frequency modulation sequences within the light signal. We note that this technology can also be used with recently developed algorithms for detection of atrial fibrillation or blood loss.},

Design This randomized control trial provided a tailored message intervention during hospitalization and 1 week and 1 month after discharge. Theoretic framework The organizing framework was the Health Belief Model. Subjects Seventy persons with a primary diagnosis of chronic HF were included in the study. Results HF readmission rates and quality of life did not significantly differ between the treatment and control groups. Health beliefs, except for benefits of medications, significantly changed from baseline in the treatment group in directions posited by the Health Belief Model. Conclusions A tailored message intervention changed the beliefs of the person with HF in regard to the benefits and barriers of taking medications, following a sodium-restricted diet, and self-monitoring for signs of fluid overload. Future research is needed to explore the effect of health belief changes on actual self-care behaviors.},

By applying the principles of distributed computing, the knowledge can be managed by experts at other locations while it is available to the clinicians as executable elements for decision support. Editability in the hands of users is essential for the success of any decision support system. A component approach for knowledge, along with a notation system for representing the components, allows editability of the protocols by the users. The knowledge components (KCs) also serve as components for an electronic medical record (EMR). Since the KCs represent activities within the clinical process, they provide easy ways to link components of other clinical or non-clinical processes that are associated or dependent. This provides for extensibility and allows conceiving of integrated information systems that can deal with diverse aspects of healthcare in the Proteus approach},

We developed a novel pulse wave detection system using low frequency specific piezoelectric material as pressure wave sensor. The transducer detects the periodic change in the arterial wall diameter produced by pressure wave and the amplified signal after integration represents the pressure wave. The signal before integration is proportional to the rate of change of pressure wave and it not only reproduces the pressure waveform faithfully, but also its sharper nature helps to reliably detect the heart period variability (HPV). We have studied the position-specific (e.g. over carotid or radial artery) nature of change of this pulse wave signal (shape and amplitude) and also the changes at different physiological states.},

The digital microcontroller provides good flexibility and interesting performance, such as the threshold monitoring, the transmission error detection, and a low power consumption, thanks to the implementation of a sleep mode. The small overall size (less than 1 cm3), the power density compatible with current regulations for the design of implantable devices, and the dedicated packaging make the system suitable for in vivo monitoring in humans.

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual basis for the systematic treatment of uncertainty in model-based decision support activities such as policy analysis, integrated assessment and risk assessment. It focuses on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers’ view on uncertainty) – uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty analysis. To that end we adopt a general definition of uncertainty as being any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty, and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind these three dimensions of uncertainty.We propose an uncertainty matrix as a heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty, thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying, articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain, policy issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Wearable sensing systems have facilitated a variety of applications in Wireless Health. Due to the considerable number of sensors and their constant monitoring these systems are often expensive and power hungry. Traditional approaches to sensor selection in large multisensory arrays attempt to alleviate these issues by removing redundant sensors while maintaining overall sensor predictability. However, predicting sensors is unnecessary if ultimately the system needs only to quantify diagnostic measurements specific to the application domain. We propose a new method for optimizing the design of medical sensor systems through diagnostic-based bottom-up sensor selection. We reduce the original sensor array from ninety nine to twelve sensors while maintaining a prediction error rate of less than 5% over all diagnostic metrics in our testing dataset.},

Least-squares regression was used to estimate BP in the first test and a repeatability test carried out half year later. BP in the repeatability test was also estimated using the regression coefficients in the first test. The results illustrated that in the first and repeatability tests (1) arterial BP increased and PTT decreased acutely after the exercises and (2) systolic BP was highly correlated with PTT. In the repeatability test, the estimation differences from the references were 0.0 ± 5.3 mmHg and 0.0 ± 2.9 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BPs respectively using least-squares regression. However, the estimation differences increased to 1.4 ± 10.2 mmHg and 2.1 ± 7.3 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BPs, respectively when the regression coefficients in the first test were used for prediction. In summary, reasonable BP estimations were given in the first and repeatability tests but not using the regression coefficients obtained 6 months ago for some subjects.},

This is achieved with the help of a high quality (Q-factor gt; 30) balanced sinusoidal current source and low noise reconfigurable readout electronics. A cm-range 13.56 MHz fabric inductor coupling is adopted to start/stop the SoC remotely. Moreover, a 5% duty-cycled Body Channel Communication (BCC) is exploited for 0.2 nJ/b 1 Mbps energy efficient external data communication. The proposed SoC occupies 5 mm #x00D7; 5 mm including pads in a standard 0.18 #x03BC;m 1P6M CMOS technology. It dissipates a peak power of 3.9 mW when operating in body channel receiver mode, and consumes 2.4 mW when operating in TIV and ECG detection mode. The SoC is integrated on a 15 cm #x00D7; 15 cm fabric circuit board together with a flexible battery to form a compact wearable sensor. With 25 adhesive screen-printed fabric electrodes, detection of TIV and ECG at 16 different sites of the heart is possible, allowing optimal detection sites to be configured to accommodate different user dependencies.},

After measuring ECG and pressure pulse, and photoplethysmography, the PTT was calculated from the acquired signals. Thereafter, the system to indirectly measure the systolic pressure and the diastolic pressure was composed using the statistic method. In comparison between the blood pressure indirectly measured by proposed algorithm estimating the blood pressure and real blood pressure measured by conventional sphygmomanometer, the systolic pressure indicates the mean error of ±3.24mmHg and the standard deviation of 2.53mmHg, while the diastolic pressure indicates the satisfactory result, that is, the mean error of ±1.80mmHg and the standard deviation of 1.39mmHg. These results are satisfied with the regulation of ANSI/AAMI for certification of sphygmomanometer that real measurement error value should be within the mean error of ±5mmHg and the standard deviation of 8mmHg. These results are suggest the possibility of applying to portable and long time blood pressure monitoring system hereafter.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensor networks are a new class of distributed systems composed of a large number of densely deployed sensors, actuators, low power computation, and wireless communication devices. Sensor network research is still in its infancy. There is a large volume of exploratory research; however, few real systems are deployed and little experimental data from sensor networks is available to test proposed protocol design. Due to lack of experimental data and sophisticated models derived from such data, most data processing algorithms from the sensor network literature are evaluated with data generated from simple models. Through statistical performance analysis and algorithm evaluation using experimental data, we demonstrate the need to evaluate algorithms using realistic data corresponding to a wide range of parameter values and irregular topology input. Motivated out of a concern for data sensitivity and a lack of experimental data, we propose a scalable synthetic data generation framework to support systematic algorithm evaluation and robust algorithm design. We have two strategies to achieve scalable synthetic data generation. First, using case studies of concrete sensor network algorithms we identify a small number of parameters to manipulate in our synthetic data generation. This significantly reduces the search space from exponential to a manageable number. Second, we use empirical models derived from experimental data to guide simulation towards those portions of the space that represent real world scenarios. Guided by these two strategies, we implement algorithms to generate synthetic data either with similar characteristics as the experimental data, or exhibiting a wide range of data characteristics. In addition to the irregular topology data generation toolbox, we also provide ready-to-use test suites to encourage people to utilize more realistic data when evaluating their algorithms. Moreover, the sensor data replay addition to EmStar enhances EmStar simulation/emulation with more realistic sensor data traces.},
