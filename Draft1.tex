  I would like to acknowledge the following individuals, without whom, this research would not have been possible. Dr. Fortier, my dissertation advisor, mentor, and friend who first recruited me into pursuing a PhD. Dr. Sethares, for her patience and for taking the time to educate me on all matters medical. My committee, whose doors have always been open anytime I needed advice. Gwen Davis who worked with me in creating the smartphone application and continued to support the study long after the funding ran out. Finally, to Professor Phil Viall, who has been my teacher in life, and engineering, for longer than I can remember. 
  
  I would also like to acknowledge the support of the IRB in approving the exploratory study at the core of this dissertation, and the funding of the UMD bridge grant.
