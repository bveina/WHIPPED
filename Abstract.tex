  Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is a complex malady caused by numerous disorders of the heart and body resulting in a decreased quality of life. Care for current cardiac patients, post-hospitalization, is not uniform often resulting in relapses and early death. Despite the emergence of numerous therapeutic innovations, prolonging life and shorten hospital stays, CHF patients often have poor prognosis. Monitoring and involving the patient in self-care has been shown to improve upon the prognosis. We propose a new and novel system for cardiac heart failure patient's self-care. This system will collect both physiologic and psychosocial data from the patient using a combination of a custom sensor suite and a smartphone. An exploratory trial evaluates the effectiveness of such an approach.

  Review and Comment Received 10/11/2016
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do not use 1st person e.g. I,me, etc.
  \item get rid of prepositions, starting sentences in particular!
  \item this helps \begin{verbatim}
	[\.!?][ ]?(of|in|to|for|with|on|at|from|by|about|as|into|like|through|after|over|between)[ ]([^\.!?]*[\.!?])
  \end{verbatim}
   \item  this, it, that, etc. replace with noun.
  \item make sure tense is consistent. youre writing about a completed piece of work so use past tense as appropriate.
  \item s/will be/..../
  \item s/will/
  \item check required format for references. if IEEE +[\#] then make sure you put references in \underline{\underline{order}} of use in dissertation.
  \item Trials - you need to beef up this section. describe all things that occured what ??? found out from data. if anything, what could be done differently, time, issues, etc.
  \item Conclusion - restate what your dissertation contributions are.
  
  \item /s/shows/indicates/
